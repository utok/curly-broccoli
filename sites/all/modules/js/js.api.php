/**
 * Register JS callbacks. Read the documentation for a detailed explanation.
 *
 * @return array
 *   An associative array of callbacks where the key indicates name of the path
 *   callback that the info should be loaded. The value of each path callback
 *   is also an associative array containing the following possible keys:
 *   - callback function: (optional) The function to invoke for this callback.
 *     If omitted, the default function name is: MODULE_js_callback_CALLBACK.
 *   - callback arguments: (optional) Select which arguments from the URL to
 *     pass to the callback. Starting with 0 with the js/[module] stripped from
 *     the path. Please note that 0 will contain the used callback.
 *   - access callback: (optional) The function to invoke for determining
 *     access to the callback. If set, the minimum bootstrap level must be
 *     DRUPAL_BOOTSTRAP_SESSION to ensure proper access validation against the
 *     current user. WARNING: If not set, no access checks are performed at all.
 *     Defaults to "user_access" if the below option (access arguments) has
 *     a value.
 *   - access arguments: (optional) Arguments for the access callback.
 *   - delivery callback: (optional) The function to call to package the results
 *     of the callback function and send it to the browser. Defaults to
 *     js_deliver_json(). Note that this function is called even if the
 *     access checks fail, so any custom delivery callback function should take
 *     that into account. See js_deliver_json() for an example.
 *   - bootstrap: (optional) The bootstrap level Drupal should boot to,
 *     defaults to DRUPAL_BOOTSTRAP_DATABASE. If an access argument/callback or
 *     tokens are used, defaults to DRUPAL_BOOTSTRAP_SESSION.
 *   - includes: (optional) Load additional files from the /includes directory,
 *     without the extension.
 *   - dependencies: (optional) Load additional modules for this callback.
 *   - file: (optional) The file where the callback function is defined.
 *   - path: (optional) The path where the callback function is defined.
 *   - lang: (optional) Boolean to forcefully enable or disable multilingual
 *     support. JS auto-detects the language string in request paths. Set
 *     this option to TRUE to enable translations, if you're not getting the
 *     desired results.
 *   - methods: (optional) The request methods allowed. This must be an array
 *     of string values. If the request does not match any of the allowed
 *     methods defined by the callback, it will be rejected.
 *   - process request: (optional) Process $_REQUEST data and provide them as
 *     matched arguments against the callback's parameter names (or as a single
 *     $data parameter). Defaults to TRUE. If unsure what this does, it's best
 *     to just leave this enabled. See js_process_post_data() for more
 *     information.
 *   - skip init: (optional) Set to TRUE to skip the init hooks. Warning:
 *     This might cause unwanted behavior and should only be disabled with care.
 *   - token: (optional) Use tokens to prevent CSRF attacks. When enabled, the
 *     minimum bootstrap level must be DRUPAL_BOOTSTRAP_SESSION to ensure
 *     proper token validation against the authenticated user. It is strongly
 *     recommended that this is not disabled, otherwise your site will be
 *     susceptible to CSRF attacks and be considered "insecure".
 *   - xss: (optional) Filters data in drupal_deliver_json() before it's sent to
 *     browser. It is strongly recommended that this is not disabled, otherwise
 *     your site will be susceptible to XSS attacks and be considered
 *     "insecure".
